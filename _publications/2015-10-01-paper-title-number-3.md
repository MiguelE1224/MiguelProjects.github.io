collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a comprehensive resilience assessment of disaster induced disruptions in transportaiton networks. Network Percolation theory and spatial analysis of household survey data was used to holistically examine the spatial patterns of risk. As first author, I performed spatial analysis on the survey data and wrote a majority of the paper'
