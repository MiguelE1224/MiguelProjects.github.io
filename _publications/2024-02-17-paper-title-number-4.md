title: "Examining data imbalance in crowdsourced reports for improving flash flood situational awareness"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This project aims to assess the use of crowdsourced data during a disaster. These datasets can enhance the situational awareness during disasters so ensuring there are limited biases is important. We look at sample bias, spatial bias, and population bias. Through the use of spatial analysis techniques the research found that census tracts had less bias compared to census blocks. Additionally, we found that minority populations and single-parent households are prone to disaster impact. As first author, my contribution to the project was writing, data processing, and all the statistical analysis.'
